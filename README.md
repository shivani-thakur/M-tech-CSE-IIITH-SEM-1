Greetings, everyone! 👋

As we embark on the Monsoon 2023 semester at IIIT Hyderabad, I’m excited to share a collection of resources that will accompany us throughout this academic journey. Our M.Tech-CSE program is packed with challenging and inspiring content, and this repository aims to be a valuable companion along the way.

Inside this repository, you’ll find a wide range of study materials—presentations, documents, notes, and more—compiled from various lectures and sessions. The content is carefully organized to help you quickly find what you need as you navigate through the courses.

## Collaboration is Key 🤝

Success in this program isn’t just about individual effort; it’s also about collaboration. I’ve contributed my own work and additional resources that I’ve found helpful. You’re encouraged to explore these materials, and if you have something valuable to share, please feel free to contribute!

In this repository, I’ve included my assignments, project work, and some supplementary notes that might offer additional insights. These are just my perspectives and interpretations, but they might provide a different angle on the topics we’re studying.

## Extra Resources 🔗

I’ve also included some external resources and readings that go beyond our course material. These are optional but could be useful if you want to deepen your understanding or explore topics that catch your interest.
